    # Introduction

    Esper APIs are a set of REST-based APIs that help you programmatically control and monitor Android-based Dedicated Devices running the Esper agent using Esper Manage. With these APIs, you can orchestrate and manage devices that have been provisioned against your Esper Manage environment. Furthermore, these APIs allows you to manage the Android applications installed on your Dedicated Device fleet. To read more about the various capabilities of Esper APIs and Esper managed devices, please visit [esper.io](https://esper.io). This guide describes all the available APIs in detail, along with code samples for you to quickly ramp up to using them.\

    To use these APIs you will need to create a developer account with Esper and get access to the Esper Dev Console and the Esper Manage Dashboard. You can find out more about Esper and sign up for free at [https://esper.io/signup](https://esper.io/signup)\

    We've done our best to keep this document up to date, but if you find any issues, please reach out to us at developer@esper.io.


    # SDK

      You are welcome to use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language in order to call these APIs, or you can use our SDK (currently supporting [python](https://github.com/esper-io/esper-client-py)) to do so.


    # Authentication

    The client needs to send authentication details to access the Esper APIs by generating and applying an API key. Be sure to sign up for your free trial account with Esper Dev to generate your key:


    # Errors

    The APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. All error responses will have a JSON body in the following format:


    ```

    {
      "errors": [],
      "message": "error message",
      "status": 400
    }

    ```

    * `errors` -  List of error details

    * `message` - Error description

    * `status` - HTTP status code

      #### API KEY - Access Token
      Access token for APIs passed as authorization header in calls. You need to generate this from your Esper Dev Console at `<domain>-api.shoonyacloud.com` where foo is the sub-domain name you gave for your Esper Dev environment when you signed up for your Esper Dev account. Please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.esper.io/home/module/genapikey.html) to generate an access token.
      Once you have the access token, you need to send an authorization header as below

      ```bash

          curl -X GET \
            https://<domain>-api.shoonyacloud.com/api/enterprise/<enterprise_id>/device/ \
            -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      ```

      > Please note the use of keyword **Bearer** before the token value.
